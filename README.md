## Description
---
Included in this repository is refactored code to create a password generator. Most of the requirements for this refactor were done by utilizing Javascript, with slight modifications to the provided HTML and CSS code. 

Working through this refactor is a perfect way to understand how to utilize functions and for loops, as well as their purpose in code. It is easy to try and explain a set of statements that perform a task should make sense, but until you write and execute something yourself, it doesn’t always truly click.
